# TASK DESCRIPTION:  MULTI-CLOUD-ARCHITECTURE

# Introduction

As part of my internship, I worked on Task 3: Multi-Cloud Architecture, where I focused on designing a system that works across two different cloud platforms. The main goal of this task was to understand and show how multiple cloud services can be used together to improve flexibility, reliability, and performance.

For this task, I mainly used Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to build and demonstrate my setup. I followed the course “Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL” on Google Cloud Skills Boost to gain practical experience and complete the task in the best possible way.

# Objective of the Task
The main aim was to design and understand a multi-cloud setup, where services are not limited to one cloud platform. Instead, they are distributed and can work across two cloud providers. While I worked hands-on with Google Cloud, I also studied how I could connect it to other platforms like AWS or Azure. The task required submitting a documentation and a demo or screenshots to show how the setup works.

# *Step 1*: Learning the Basics

First, I began with the course Google Cloud Fundamentals, which helped me understand core services like Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL. I learned how to:

Create and manage storage buckets

Upload files

Set up access controls

Create and manage SQL database instances using Cloud SQL

This course gave me a strong base to work on cloud projects.

# *Step 2*: Building in Google Cloud

Next, I applied what I learned:

I created a Cloud Storage bucket to upload a sample file

I configured bucket permissions to control access (such as private or public)

I created a Cloud SQL instance and set up a basic database

I explored connection methods like authorized networks and SQL users

These actions showed me how storage and database services work together in the cloud. I took screenshots of my setup as proof.

# *Step 3*: Designing Multi-Cloud Architecture

Although I couldn’t fully deploy services on another platform due to account limits, I studied how Google Cloud services can be made to work with another cloud like AWS. For example:

A frontend hosted on AWS could send data to a Cloud SQL database on GCP

Or a file stored in Google Cloud Storage could be used by a backend service in Azure

To show this, I created a diagram that explained how services on different clouds would communicate using public endpoints, API connections, or VPNs. I also included notes on how GCP's Cloud VPN, VPC Peering, or Load Balancers could be used to support multi-cloud architecture.

# Deliverables Submitted:

As part of my GitHub repository and project files, I submitted:

Screenshots of Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL setup

A basic architecture diagram showing multi-cloud design

A README file explaining my project in simple words

Notes from the Skill Boost course to show what I learned

# Conclusion:

This task helped me understand how companies today don’t always use just one cloud provider. Instead, they often use multiple platforms depending on the need. By working on Google Cloud and learning from the course, I now know how multi-cloud systems can be planned and what tools are used to connect services across providers. I believe this experience gave me a better view of how real-world cloud systems are built and managed.
